About the Project

This project is a Digital Signature and Verifier web application built using Django. It allows users to:

Upload documents securely

Generate digital signatures for documents

Verify the authenticity of digitally signed documents

The app ensures document integrity and helps in validating that the signature matches the document, providing a trustworthy way to confirm document authenticity.

The project is designed to demonstrate secure handling of digital signatures in a web environment and can be extended for real-world use cases requiring document signing and verification.
